                     <p>The <objectType>figurine</objectType> stands about <height unit="inch"
                     quantity="8">8 inches</height> in height and is composed of a penguin
                     standing on top of a misshapen rock. It is made out of
                     <material>ceramic</material> material and has a shiny, glazed surface.
                     The penguin stands with its flippers placed on its hips, and its head
                     cocked at a slight angle. <seg corresp="#penguinRock">Its feet are painted onto the rock it stands
                     upon, which is grey/green, about <height unit="inch" quantity="2">2
                        inches</height> tall, and textured with tiered grooves.</seg> This texturing
                     leads to the rock being very misshapen on the sides but smooth on top.
                     There are also small holes of about <dim unit="centimeter" quantity="1">1
                        centimeter</dim> in diameter in various spots on the rock. The rock
                     part of the figurine is hollow while the penguin is not. </p>
